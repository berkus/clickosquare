This is Gtk+-2.0 reincarnation of popular Windows game Clickomania.

Thanks to Jorge Arellano Cid for Dillo as both great browser and source of
good style Gtk+ programming.


* Features to add:

Standard clickomania features:
Animations of falling blocks.
Additional block types (bombs and lasers..)

Extra features:

Multiplayer, with up to infinite number of players
with two modes: cooperative (try cooperatively to solve the whole thing),
competetive (the player who solves the last figure, wins).
another competetive: who solved more figures than others earns more scores.
Semi-sequential (next player has 15 seconds timeout within which he has to
make his move, otherwise all other players become able to solve) and
parallel - all players can solve simultaneously.
One-to-one - there are two stacks, which players solve simultaneosly (as
in tetris) the one who finishes first, wins.

Internet ratings page - top 500 or something like that! (e.g. "Internet submit"
button + some kind of protection scheme to avoid cheaters).
(as one method - allow playing on internet server through ssl, this adds
need for client/server interaction model).

Blocks may 1) fall down and move to the left or,
2) move outwards the center (above grid half go top, below go bottom).

Playground actions:
a) On mouse click - check where clicked and determine whether we should
destroy some blocks? If so, push undo state, destroy them, start animation
thread and emit "blocks_destroyed" signal.
